                  A client in the real-estate photography business was looking for way to more efficiently manage the scheduling of photo shoots to keep up with the growth of its business and team of photographers. The previous proces would involve the manual booking of appointments, which was error-prone and made monthly invoicing a cumbersome task. In addition to automation, there was a need to add a confirmation workflow to reduce no-shows.
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Execution</h4>
                <div>
                  Created a Python Django application with custom admin screens to provide a fully customized booking screen that is optimized for mobile as well as desktop. To keep technical maintenance to a minimum, Heroku was selected as the PaaS provider. On creating and updating a project, through the use of APIs the system automatically updates the photographer's calendar and creates a uniform project folder in the team's Dropbpox. The client then receives an email asking them to confirm the booking, which is logged in the system. On completion of the assigment, the system sends an email with a download link to the client, and the system integrates with a 3rd party invoicing tool to allow the assigment to be invoiced.

                  Belmont Consultancy is the founder of <a class="underline hover:decoration-2" href="https://downdetector.com">Downdetector</a>, the world's largest website for reporting and tracking service outages. The platform allows users to report issues with online services and track the status of reported outages in real-time. The platform was acquired by Ookla. Centered around the vision that user reports are the best way to report service disruptions, Downdetector offers the fastest outage detection available in the market today.

                <div>
                  Downdetector went through multiple plaform iterations to keep up with the growing user base and features, starting with traditional server hosting and moving to a highly scalable cloud environment based on AWS at the time of acquisition.  
                  Following the acquisition by Ookla, Belmont Consultancy was asked to stay on board in the role of product owner to ensure a smooth handover. On completion of this process, we decided to return to a role that offered more enterpreurial freedom.

                  <a class="underline hover:decoration-2" href="https://suprondjehaarlem.nl">Sup Rondje Haarlem</a> is an annual paddleboarding race and tour in the city of Haarlem. A website was need to offer greater visibility. The abilility to register beyond a simple form was a welcome addition to reduce manual tasks by the event organisers both leading up to the event and on race-day.

                <div>
                  With a traffic peak shortly before the event, a scaleable soltion with minimal overhead was called for. We settled on a solution using Node which builds a static website on deployment that is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, combined with a lightweight D1 database and Workers for the registration and payment process.

                  Building static pages during deploys, combined with cloud services provides the highly scalable Cloudflare plafform, while the lack of servers leads to zero hosting costs during the off-season.

    Belmont Consultancy is founded by Tom Sanders. Just like Belmont Consultancy, my expertise lies in agililty and tackling business problems. I enjoy endurance sports, because just like your business needs, performing in an ultra race requires preparation, strategy, persistence and the ability to adapt to ever changing conditions. The same agility can be found in my prior experience, which include working as a reporter, a 6-year posting as a foreign correspondent in the San Francisco Bay Area, and managing 5 publications as Group Editor in Chief.
